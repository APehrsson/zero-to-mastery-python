#OOP, a way to think about and structure code. After making an object you can use it again and again 
#The class is the blueprint. From the blueprint you can create objects over and over. Instances is a created object from a class

class BigObject: #Class
    pass

obj1 = BigObject() #instanciate
obj2 = BigObject() #instanciate
obj3 = BigObject() #instanciate

print(type(None))
print(type(True))
print(type(5))
print(type(5.5))
print(type('hi'))
print(type([]))
print(type(()))
print(type({}))
print(type(obj1))
